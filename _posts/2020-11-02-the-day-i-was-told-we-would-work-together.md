Another course that I feared was the analysis class. I already knew I was missing some fundamental knowledge, but I would never expect to be that surprised the first time I saw multivariable functions. I was convinced that the teacher made a mistake, but he didn't. However, I was told that there was no need to panic. The teacher said that we would work together. Not sure what he meant by that, but we never worked together at all. What we actually did, or rather, what he did, instead, was to break me mentally during the exam to such an extent that I don't feel any pressure about anything today, and I probably won't ever.

We're gonna work together, he said. Die, you piece of \*\*\*\*!
