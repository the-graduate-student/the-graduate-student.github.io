I was just graduating from some engineering school, but there was no particular area of computer science that I really enjoyed. Despite my degree in software engineering, I didn't feel like an engineer at all, not to mention I didn't see myself having a job yet. Moreover, I was still thirsty for knowledge. In that regard, I decided to apply to a so-called prestigious institute of technology. There, I was definitely convinced that I would get a high-quality education, that I would be taught by capable, motivated, and invested people, and that I would eventually find my way. My foot! If only I had known that I was going to live a remake of the Vietnam War...

Semper Fi.
