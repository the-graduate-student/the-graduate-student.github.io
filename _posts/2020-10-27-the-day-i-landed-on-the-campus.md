My first day among the so-called next generation of elitist engineers finally came. Back then, I didn't have much confidence in myself, and I was scared to get started. The reason was that classmates of mine from my previous university were kicked out of that institute back in the day. From what I could observe, they were quite talented but still failed, unfortunately for them. Despite my concerns, I couldn't wait to attend my first lecture. After all, I expected to get plenty in my eyes. So I took the subway to get to the campus, and I pretty much felt homesick right away I set foot outside. It was like I had crossed an invisible border of some unknown country without me being aware of it. People gave off a feeling of superiority that I didn't like at all. It pissed me off, a lot. And for some reason, they seemed happy, very happy, too happy, and they couldn't stop talking. All these smart-asses trying to impress one another. These guys always got on my nerves. So there they were, the people I would never get close to because I would have slapped them all day long. And by people, I mean all of them. The semester just began, and I already hated both the place and the people there...

Not a great start so far.
