At last, my first lecture was about to start. It would be about computer architecture. My buddy and I entered the auditorium. We wanted to avoid any distractions and listen carefully to the teacher. In that regard, we decided to act as model students and sat in the front row. It goes without saying it didn’t last as we would eventually come to understand that lectures were actually a huge waste of time. Anyhow, the lecture started, the teacher seemed nice, but the content was not really interesting, however. Actually, given our respective backgrounds, my buddy and I realized right away that we already knew most of the course material, if not more so. This essentially meant that we wouldn’t learn anything new. Still, already knowing the material didn’t prevent us from totally screwing up the final exam, but that’s a story for another time.

Goodness! Who gives a \*\*\*\* about how a \*\*\*\*\*\*\* multiplier work?
