The second day arrived, and that day was supposed to be particularly exciting for me. I was going to have a class about functional programming, but I couldn't care less about this programming paradigm. What I was looking forward to was being taught by the author himself. With such an opportunity, I thought I could ask him about every single detail of the language. My dream pretty much fell apart in the blink of an eye. We were told that all the lectures had been recorded beforehand and made available online for us to watch. Furthermore, the exercise sessions would be led by the teaching assistants only. And sadly, it turned out to be true as the bastard didn't show up until the final, not even once. Screw him and all those teachers who don't give a damn about their classes, delegate all the work to their slave assistants, and focus their effort only on their damn research.

My buddy talking to the teacher at the end of the class:

\> "So, can I use your programming language to develop on FPGAs?"

< "No, you can't."

\> "Well, your language is useless then..."
