The disappointment about the functional programming class didn't last long. I had to get prepared for the next day because something big was coming, and no, it was not winter, but the physics class. The classmates I mentioned earlier were actually kicked out because they failed this class twice for most of them. And since my previous university didn't bother to teach us about physics, it felt like going to the frontline with a wooden knife. Lucky for me, I quickly realized that both the teacher and the course had changed in the meantime. Feeling relieved and full of hope, I opened the teacher's textbook and started reading about the next day's lesson: Greek symbols, Maxwell's equations, monstrous integrals, magical derivations, illustrations looking like abstract art... What in the holiest of \*\*\*\*\*! I couldn't understand a damn thing, and there was no way I would pass the class with such a crappy document. God bless my buddy for finding a book at the library that would save my ass, but my ass ended up not being saved as some unfortunate situation came up during the exam.

Darf ich bitte auf die Toilette gehen?
