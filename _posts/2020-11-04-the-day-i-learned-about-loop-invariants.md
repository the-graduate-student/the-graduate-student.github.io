title: The day I learned about loop invariants

A new week started, with another class to discover, that is, the algorithms class. I had already took such a class from my previous university. Therefore, the beginning of the lesson was kind of similar to what I had learned back then. Then the professor brought up a topic that I never heard about. Loop invariants were introduced to us. For some reason, the guy made it sound like it was a big deal, like somebody had just invented the measles vaccine, or something. What's so amazing about proving that a fucking loop behaves as expected? It was the typical bullshit that was purely theoretical and which found no application in the daily life of an engineer. Just because the reference book of the course bothered introducing such a topic didn't mean that it was worth teaching it. Given that my buddy and I were coming from some university of applied sciences, we were trained to be pragmatic: one shouldn't study something that won't be used afterward. As one might expect, my buddy and I couldn't care less about this kind of crap, and the pile of crap that was taught kept getting bigger and bigger during the semester, or rather until graduation.

    I didn't give a shit before learning about them
  Maintenance:
    I didn't give a shit while learning about them
