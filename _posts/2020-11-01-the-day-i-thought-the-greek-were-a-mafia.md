This first week full of disappointment was almost over. All that was left was a computer networks class. As usual, I wanted to have a look at the material of today's lesson before the lecture. Usually, I would quickly skip the slides about the course administrivia, but not this time because something caught my attention. Taking a closer look at the names of the teaching staff, I noticed a common pattern: Adamos, Danielopoulos, Frangopoulos, Konstantinopolites, Nicolaides, Papachristodoulopoulos, Xenakis, etc. For some obscure reason, most of them were Greek, and for some more obscure reason, those were all Ph.D. students, part of the professor's laboratory. Now, I don't know if Greek folks are renowned for their expertise in computer networks. Still, it couldn't have been just a coincidence. Time proved me right as I observed the same situation for other classes with different professors but with the same Greek predominance in the teaching staff. Something was definitely fishy in the admission process of Ph.D. candidates.

**DISCLAIMER**

_I am neither racist, nor I have something against Greek folks. For what it's worth, I happen to be one-third Greek. What I wanted to point out here is a deficiency in the academic system of the institute of technology of interest. Ph.D. candidates should be chosen based on their proficiency, not on some professor's preference for an ethnic group._
