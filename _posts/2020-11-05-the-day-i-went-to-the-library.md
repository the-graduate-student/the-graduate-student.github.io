Considering that both lectures and exercise sessions wouldn't help me to survive the physics and analysis classes, I had been thinking that some books might be of help. In that regard, I decided to go to the library. Rumors were suggesting that it took more than $100 million to build it. I wasn't expecting anything too fancy, but I was actually hoping to see the kind of libraries one would find in American movies with such an investment. Finally facing the library, I was very disappointed to see whatever that thing was supposed to be. The building looked like a degenerated slice of gruy√®re, with holes everywhere to the point where I was wondering whether maybe a hostile country had bombarded the damn place recently. So far, the first impression was not good, but the library's inside could have changed my opinion. It wasn't the case, unfortunately: wasted space, lack of seating, distracting view of the outdoors, poor collections of books. The place looked more like a _cheap_ piece of art than a library.

Oh, I forgot about the actual reason for me going to the library. In the end, I didn't find any books that turned out to be useful...
