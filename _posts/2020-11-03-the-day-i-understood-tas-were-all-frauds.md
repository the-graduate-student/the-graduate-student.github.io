The class was barely over when I didn't even have time to digest the material just taught, and the exercise session was right afterward. At that moment, I thought it wasn't a big deal since I felt that I understood the material well enough to tackle the exercises. With this in mind, I told myself I would be okay for this course as long as I paid attention during class and practiced seriously. The session started. The teaching staff provided us with the very first exercise sheet. I took out my pen and looked at the first problem: _parameterize the curve that is the intersection of the two hemispheres_. After reading that statement, my buddy and I didn't understand how it was related to today's lecture and how one could solve it. Therefore, we asked a TA for explanations, but it didn't help. We asked a second TA, but we were still lost as ever. We finally asked a third TA, and he told us that there were several ways to solve it, to which we replied one way would be enough. The dude then started a long demonstration to eventually realize that he was going nowhere. He tried to keep up appearances as best as he could, but we could see he was talking nonsense. That day, my buddy and I decided to never come back to these sessions as the teaching assistants were all full of shit.
