title: The day I became devoid of social life

As far as I remember, I hadn't had a rich social life since I was a teenager. It changed a bit at the time of my previous university. Back then, I was part of a local football team, and I also joined a karate dojo. Even though it was quite hard to bear with the amount of work between assignments, group projects, and continuous assessments, sports was a nice way out for me to breathe. In the end, it didn't bother me that much to be overloaded by work as I was enjoying everything I was studying, and I still got the time to relax with group sporting activities. Joining that freaking institute of technology basically crushed the balance that I had been relying on until then. It didn't take more than a week to drop the karate classes for good and a year to retire from my football team. My daily days eventually became no different than a piece of code:

```cpp
#include "basic_human_functions.h"

void main(void) {
  while (1) {
    sleep();
    work();
    eat();
  }
}
```

Glory to God for helping me making through the constant mental exhaustion, and God bless my buddy for taking bullets for me under enemy fire.
