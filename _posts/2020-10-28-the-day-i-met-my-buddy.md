Before my first lecture, I was supposed to meet someone, another engineer who had decided to take the very same journey as I did. We agreed beforehand we would meet so we met. We introduced ourselves. He told me he got screwed by the admission office as they rejected his initial application. He actually applied to the electrical engineering program. The dude happened to be some kind of electrical, embedded systems, thing engineer-- whatever that means. But for some obscure reason, _computer science_ appeared on his previous engineer degree, though. And that's precisely what screwed him. Those idiots from the admission office didn't go further than looking at that document and concluded he had a computer science background. If they had just looked at the previous curriculum he took, they would definitely have understood that he was in no way a computer scientist. As he used to say, he and I don't exercise the same profession, and this was very true. In any case, he ended up in the computer science department along with me and tried to make the best out of it despite everything. Big mistake! Naive as I was, he had so much hope, but so many disappointments were expecting him. Nevertheless, this man would eventually become my brother-in-arms, and I can't praise enough the Lord for having appointed me such a loyal companion in the hell the two of us got into.

FUBAR.
