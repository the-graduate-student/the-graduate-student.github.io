Hello there,

it is my pleasure to tell you the truish story of τηε γραδυατε στυδεντ<sup>1</sup>, an ordinary guy that studied computer science at some random institute of technology, and who wanted to share how bad it went. The story is told in the form of a logbook that relates the "funny" adventures of yours truly, from the very first day of school until graduation. Each entry of the logbook shares whatever worth mentioning the poor guy did, said, felt, saw, heard, learned, or experienced during his long journey-- and what a horrible journey that was!

**τηε γραδυατε στυδεντ**

\[1\] τηε γραδυατε στυδεντ stands for "the graduate student". Learn your Greek alphabet, you damn illiterate.
